**UPLPlayer** is an alternative application to control playback of the UPL96ETL, with the following features:

- Offers a simple interface (folder based) to browse albums and control playback of the UPL (no tags and images are used)

- Albums can be stored on USB drives as "single wav files" with **cue sheets**. This allows for more albums to be stored on each drive (max: 98000 albums). Albums can be played gaplessly.
