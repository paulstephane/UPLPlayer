The **UPL96ETL** by ECDesigns is a high fidelity audio source that plays music files stored on USB drives.  [ECDesigns product page](https://www.ecdesigns.nl/en/blog/upl96etl)

**UPLPlayer** is an alternative application to control playback of the UPL96ETL, with the following features:

- Offers a very simple web interface (folder based, tags and images are not used) to browse the content of your USB drive(s) and control playback of the UPL

- Albums can be stored on USB drives as "single wav files" with **cue sheets**. This allows for more albums to be stored on each drive (max: 98000 albums per drive). Albums can be played gaplessly.
